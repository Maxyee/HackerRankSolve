## ITERATION

Into this file we are going to discuss about the Iteration Over Object. Iteration depends on how many time that program is executing.
Suppose we have 5 coins, Now if I want to move that five coin from one place to another one by one, then I have to do this work 5 times.
This 5 times work is programmatically called the Iteration. Into this file I will discuss that Iteration with the objects.

## OBJECT

Objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of
“key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively,
in the context of an object.
